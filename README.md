Data Analysis - Guided projects

These are my first steps into Data Analysis. 

In this repository I will post step-by-step Guided Projects found on the web in languages such as Python, R and SQL. 
The sources of the projects can be found at the beginning of the code.

I decided to name it "fractals" because of my fascination with them and their infinite area as a symbol of the infinite possibilities for topics to analyse in this repo.
