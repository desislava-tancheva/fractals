# fractals
Data Analysis - Guided projects

These are my first steps into Data Analysis. 

In this repository I will post Guided Projects found on the web in languages such as Python, R and SQL. 
The Sources of the projects will always be at the beginning of the code.

I decided to name it "fractals" because I'am facinated with fractals and they have infinite area - as i intend this repo to be.
